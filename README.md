haven't you ever wanted some positive reinforcement when you finally get those tests to pass?

# installation

you can `cargo install cargo-clicker`.

# usage

add "clicker" immediately after cargo and program with extra reinforcement

```
$ cargo clicker test
```

# configuration

* `CARGO_CLICKER_SILENCE` - never play sound when this variable is set
* `CARGO_CLICKER_RESPONSES` - directory containing "Positive" and "Negative" subdirectories with custom reinforcement~

`cargo-clicker` comes with some built in clicks, but if you want special treatment then set `CARGO_CLICKER_RESPONSES`
appropriately and have at it. if the appropriate directory is empty, no sound be played.
